Me (Mon, 12:02 PM): You alive?
Leo (Mon, 1:55 PM): Work tsunami. You know I adore you tho 🤍

CONTEXT: Date was fireworks. Since then it's night-texts, last-minute cancels, big compliments but no calendar.

MY GUT: Brain says "green flag words," body says "red flag actions." Feels like love-bomb → limp breadcrumb. Is he busy or keeping me in the shiny box for dopamine pings?`

Miles (6:03 PM): Share live location so I know you're actually on a tram.
Ava (6:04 PM): Not doing tracking. I'll be there at 6:15.
Miles (6:05 PM): If you loved me you'd calm my anxiety instead of being difficult.
Ava (6:17 PM): I'm outside the bar.
Miles (6:28 PM): I'm not coming. Work emergency. You're overreacting anyway.
Ava (6:29 PM): You asked me to meet. I showed up.
Miles (6:31 PM): Jess says you've been distant. Even my friends notice.
Ava (6:33 PM): Jess met me twice.
Miles (11:41 PM): I'm at your door. Let me in so we can finish this.
Ava (11:42 PM): It's midnight. Not tonight.
Miles (11:43 PM): Wow. Dramatic. Delete that beach pic too—my cousin follows me.
Ava (11:44 PM): No.
Miles (11:45 PM): Silent treatment activated.
— Next day —
Ava (10:06 AM): Are we talking?

Miles (1:12 AM): Let's reset. I brought flowers 🌹
Ava (7:34 AM): Flowers don't fix patterns.
Miles (7:36 AM): Patterns like you flirting with the bartender?
Ava (7:37 AM): I said thanks for water.
Miles (7:39 AM): Whatever. Also I left my hoodie "by accident." Keep it safe.
Ava (12:02 PM): Picked it up.
Miles (12:05 PM): I'll swing by later. Don't post anything till then; people talk.
Ava (12:07 PM): I'm not living by your PR rules.
Miles (12:10 PM): Share your location and we're fine.
Ava (12:12 PM): Boundary stands: schedule in daylight, no pop-ins.
Miles (12:13 PM): Guess you don't care.
Miles (12:15 PM): I care about respect.
Miles (12:17 PM): Enjoy being single then.
Ava (12:20 PM): If that's your choice, noted.`

Jae (7:45 PM): Let's do rules that aren't weird: if I'm out late, I send "home by X."
Nina (7:46 PM): Works. I'll do the same when I'm off-grid.
Jae (7:48 PM): Also I saw your DM to Eli about the zine; my lizard brain read flirty.
Nina (7:50 PM): It was layout talk, not heart talk.
Jae (7:51 PM): Cool. I'll ask next time, not spiral.
Nina (7:53 PM): Capacity check: I'm yellow tonight. Short call?
Jae (7:54 PM): Yellow too. 15-min debrief then Mario Kart ceasefire?
Nina (7:55 PM): Deal.

Jae (9:11 PM): Also… I joked about your caption last week. It landed mean. Sorry.
Nina (9:13 PM): Thanks for naming it. I'm sensitive about that; appreciate the catch.
Jae (9:15 PM): Re: Sunday—my sis asked if you'll come to her picnic. Dog-friendly.
Nina (9:16 PM): Yes, but I'll bail at 3 to prep Monday.
Jae (9:17 PM): I'll walk you to the tram at 2:55.
Nina (9:18 PM): Phones away during picnic?
