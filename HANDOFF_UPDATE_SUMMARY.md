## Deep Dive UI + Save/Share Updates (Sept 30, 2025)

This section documents the latest product/design changes and the exact implementation details so future devs can maintain parity across mobile/desktop and the export flows.

### What changed
- Split metrics into their own card beneath the summary headline.
- Removed the "SAGE'S SUMMARY" and "HOT TAKE ANALYSIS" header row.
- Teal visual system applied to emoji chips and accent borders (kept original gradient container and teal border system).
- Mobile Autopsy: switched from 2x2 grid to a horizontal snap scroller.
- Desktop Autopsy: kept 2x2 grid; added primary-card emphasis (thicker teal border, teal hover glow); constrained layout with `max-w-5xl mx-auto`.
- Removed the entire "SAGE'S DYNAMICS" section per request.
- Receipt schema in UI updated to new fields: `bestie_look`, `calling_it`, `vibe_check`.

### Save/Share behavior (dom-to-image)
Files: `src/components/DeepDive.jsx`

We have two buttons: Save (normal) and Save Clean.

Shared goals:
- Preserve centering and sizing parity across both flows
- Avoid horizontal shift caused by mobile scroller negative margins

Key implementation details:
- Both flows capture the root `[data-deepdive-component]` with the same transform sizing used by the original implementation:
  - `width: element.offsetWidth * 2`
  - `height: element.offsetHeight * 2`
  - `style: { transform: 'scale(2)', transformOrigin: 'top left' }`
  - `bgcolor: '#1a1a2e'`
- During capture, we temporarily neutralize mobile scroller margins and left-align the root element to guarantee a consistent left origin for dom-to-image. After export, all margins are restored.
- Save Clean hides `data-share-hide="true"` nodes and all Autopsy items with `data-index >= 2`, then restores them post-capture.

Code anchors:
- Normal Save handler: `handleSaveTea` (adds temporary margin overrides, restores after capture)
- Clean Save handler: `handleSaveClean` (same margin overrides + hide/show logic)
- Mobile scroller marker: `[data-autopsy-horizontal]` (added to the horizontal container)

### Prompt/Analysis changes (context enforcement)
Files: `src/lib/analysis/advancedAnalysis.js`, `src/lib/prompts/brutalPrompt.js`, `src/lib/prompts/deepDivePrompt.js`, `src/lib/prompts/immunityPrompt.js`

- Role enforcement added to prompts: a "CRITICAL ROLE ASSIGNMENT" header prevents USER/OTHER inversion.
- Name extraction simplified and made explicit: `user_name`/`user_side` takes absolute priority; OTHER is anyone not that name.
- Pre- and post-processing sanitization prevents the model from using JSON field names (e.g., `chat_excerpt`) as person names.
- Immunity prompt placeholder replacement switched to global regex to replace all occurrences (not just first).

### Safety detection (false-positive fix)
- Rewrote boundary detection to be context-agnostic and pattern-based.
- Violence/assault detection uses a higher threshold in non-romantic contexts.
- Added grooming and age-gap checks.

### How to test quickly
1) Mobile Autopsy: narrow viewport, verify horizontal snap scrolling and per-card dots. Use Save/Clean Save; exports should not shift horizontally.
2) Desktop Autopsy: wide viewport, confirm 2x2 grid with emphasized first card, `max-w-5xl` container, teal hover glow.
3) Verify that Dynamics section is absent.
4) Confirm Save vs Save Clean: Clean should hide metrics and excess autopsy items; both exports should preserve left alignment.

### Known flags / future knobs
- If export needs padding, apply a temporary wrapper only during capture; keep UI untouched. Current implementation left-aligns by margin overrides for consistency.
- For absolute parity across all share modes (e.g., 9:16 builder), consider extracting a shared capture helper.
