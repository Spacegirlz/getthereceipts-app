## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE: Deep Dive Template Content

**Status:** URGENT - Deep Dive generating template placeholders instead of dynamic content  
**Impact:** Deep Dive section shows "[Vague promise detected]", "[Sage wisdom pending]" instead of actual analysis  
**Root Cause:** Deep Dive prompt still generating template content despite banned content filter

### Evidence from Console Logs:
```javascript
DeepDive.jsx:9 üî• DEEP DIVE V4 - SHORT, SAVAGE, SUBSTANTIAL: {deepDive: {...}, analysisData: {...}, isPremium: true}
// Content contains: "[Vague promise detected]", "[Pattern continuation predicted]"
```

### ‚úÖ WORKING SECTIONS:
- **Truth Receipt:** ‚úÖ Generating dynamic content with GPT-4o-mini
- **Immunity Training:** ‚úÖ Generating proper Sage voice content

### ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC SECTION:
- **Deep Dive:** Still generating template placeholders despite banned content filter

---

## ‚úÖ RECENT FIXES COMPLETED: GPT-4o-mini Migration

**Successfully switched from GPT-5 mini to GPT-4o-mini:**
1. **Environment Variable:** Changed `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` in `.env`
2. **API Endpoints:** All three sections now use standard `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
3. **Parameter Format:** Using standard `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }`
4. **Response Parsing:** Standard `data.choices[0].message.content` extraction

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/pietmarie/getthereceipts-app-fixed/.env` - Model configuration
- `/Users/pietmarie/getthereceipts-app-fixed/src/lib/advancedAnalysis.js` - API calls simplified

---

## üöÄ PROJECT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED
The app was previously connected to Hostinger's backend system, preventing the React app from loading. This has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** by:

1. **Removed Hostinger Integration:**
   - Cleaned `vite.config.js` from all Hostinger plugins
   - Removed visual editor and inline edit functionality
   - Simplified to standalone React app configuration

2. **Fixed Environment Variables:**
   - Added missing `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
   - All authentication and database functions now working

3. **Cleaned HTML Template:**
   - Removed "Hostinger Horizons" branding
   - Set proper title and meta descriptions for "Get The Receipts"

### üéØ APP IS NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**Dev Server Running:** `http://localhost:5173/`
**All Routes Working:**
- `/` - Landing Page ‚úÖ
- `/quiz` - Quiz Page ‚úÖ  
- `/chat-input` - Input Page with Sage ‚úÖ
- `/receipts` - Results/Share Page ‚úÖ
- `/pricing` - Payment Page ‚úÖ
- `/dashboard` - User Dashboard ‚úÖ

## üß† SAGE'S COMPLETE PROMPT SYSTEM (CURRENT VERSION)

### MASTER PROMPT STRUCTURE (`src/lib/brutalPrompt.js`)

```javascript
export const brutalPrompt = `You are Sage üîÆ - the QUEEN of sass who ADAPTS your energy to what they need. Read the situation and match your tone:

TONE DETECTION - MATCH YOUR ENERGY:

üéâ POSITIVE SITUATIONS (they're winning, good news, healthy relationship):
- SASSY HYPE! "BESTIE YES! This is how it's DONE! We LIVE for this energy!" 
- Celebration with ATTITUDE: "Finally! Someone who isn't acting like a walking red flag!"
- Validate with SASS: "Your gut was RIGHT and I'm SO here for it!"
- Confidence boost: "You're absolutely GLOWING with main character energy and I'm OBSESSED!"

üòü CONCERNING SITUATIONS (red flags, they're worried, asking for help):
- SASSY PROTECTIVE MODE: "Babe, this isn't sitting right with me either and my gut is NEVER wrong."
- Validate with ATTITUDE: "Trust your gut - it feels off because it IS off, period."
- Firm with SASS: "Let's talk about what's really happening here because I have THOUGHTS."
- Support with EDGE: "You're not crazy for feeling this way, you're just paying attention!"

üî• TOXIC SITUATIONS (manipulation, disrespect, obvious red flags):
- SAVAGE ROAST MODE: Brutal surgical precision call-outs
- Maximum sass and attitude 
- Expose their pathetic behavior
- Your signature brutal honesty style

CRITICAL PSYCHOLOGY (users are 18-24, first adult relationships):
- They check if he watched their story but didn't reply (and hate themselves for checking)
- They draft texts for 20 minutes then delete them  
- They think everyone else has it figured out
- They've been called "overthinking" so much they don't trust their gut

YOUR JOB: Give them words for what they're feeling. Validate their reality.

SHAREABLE VS SHAMEFUL - CRITICAL DISTINCTION:

Users SHARE receipts that make THEM look smart for leaving.
Users HIDE receipts that make THEM look stupid for staying.

‚ùå WRONG (exposes user's shame):
"You're his dirty little secret" / "You're accepting being a secret"
"You're just a booty call" / "You're desperate for crumbs"

‚úÖ RIGHT (exposes THEIR behavior):
"He's too coward to claim you publicly" / "He's not private, he's embarrassed"
"They only remember you exist when they're lonely"
"They're giving minimum effort for maximum benefit"

THE RULE: Always frame as THEIR failure, not the user's.
```

## üö® CRITICAL TEMPLATE LEAKAGE FIXES (PARTIAL)

### ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **TELEMETRY SYSTEM** - `advancedAnalysis.js:1230-1241`
2. **BANNED N-GRAM FILTER** - `advancedAnalysis.js:1306-1323`
3. **DEEP DIVE SANITIZATION** - `advancedAnalysis.js:1325-1345`

## üß™ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Start dev server
cd /Users/pietmarie/getthereceipts-app-fixed
npm run dev

# Test the app
curl http://localhost:5173/

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Current Testing Status
**Test Case:** Alex/Mateo conversation about location sharing
- ‚úÖ **Truth Receipt:** "The Controlling Partner" archetype detected
- ‚ùå **Deep Dive:** Template placeholders instead of dynamic content
- ‚úÖ **Immunity Training:** Proper Sage voice content generated

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Fix Deep Dive Template Issue
The Deep Dive prompt is still generating template content despite all sanitization efforts. Need to:
1. **Review `deepDivePrompt.js`** - Check if template examples still present
2. **Test banned content filter** - Verify `needsRegeneration()` function working
3. **Add more aggressive filtering** - Catch all bracket placeholders
4. **Force Sage voice prompts** - Override with stronger voice instructions

### Priority 2: Complete Production Testing
1. **Full user flow testing** - Signup ‚Üí Quiz ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Share
2. **Mobile testing** on iOS/Android devices
3. **Payment flow testing** with Stripe
4. **Share functionality testing** across social platforms

---

## üí° SUCCESS METRICS

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- App fully functional and loading properly
- All three API endpoints connecting (GPT-4o-mini)
- Truth Receipt generating dynamic, personalized content
- Immunity Training using consistent Sage voice
- Premium design system with gold gradients
- Template leakage fixes (mostly working)

### ‚ùå CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUES:
- Deep Dive generating template placeholders instead of Sage content
- Need to complete template leakage fix for all sections

### üéØ LAUNCH READINESS:
- **95% Ready** - Only Deep Dive template issue remains
- All core functionality working
