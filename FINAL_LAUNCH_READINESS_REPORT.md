## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

### **Issue #2: Payment Processing Failure**

**Impact**: Users paid but didn't receive credits/upgrades  
**Solution**: Complete webhook system overhaul with proper event handling  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

### **Issue #3: False Advertising Risk**

**Impact**: Legal liability, user trust damage if discovered  
**Solution**: Replaced with honest "Limited Time" messaging  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

### **Issue #4: Poor Purchase Experience**
**Problem**: Success page showed generic message regardless of purchase type  
**Impact**: User confusion, potential duplicate payments  
**Solution**: Dynamic success page with subscription-specific messaging  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**
