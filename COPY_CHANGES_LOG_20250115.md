## ✅ All 5 Improvements Implemented

### 1. Typography Standardization ✅
- **Standardized all body text:**
  - Primary body: `text-xl` (was: text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl mixed)
  - Secondary body: `text-base` (was: text-base, text-lg mixed)
- **Section headers:** `text-5xl` (consistent)
- **Subsection headers:** `text-3xl` (consistent)
- **Result:** Clean, consistent typography scale throughout

### 2. Visual Hierarchy Enhancements ✅
- **Premium card:** Scale increased from 1.05x to 1.15x (desktop only)
- **Animated "MOST POPULAR" badge:** Pulse animation (scale + y movement)
- **Enhanced spacing:** Increased gap between pricing cards (gap-8 → gap-12)
- **Visual interest:** Added animated pricing badge with sparkles icon

### 3. Mobile Sticky CTA ✅

### 4. Content Density Refinement ✅
- **Sage description section:** Converted paragraphs to bullet format with icons
  - ✨ "Made for laughs, clarity, and maybe a little reality check"
  - 💅 "Savage takes. Zero filter. Made with love."
  - ⚡ "70% savage, 30% supportive. Drag → Decode → Soft slap of truth → Tiny uplift."
